diskpart              (this enters the DISKPART command line interface)

list volume           (identify the EFI volume, will be about 100Mb, labelled Info=System, Fs=FAT32)
list disk             (identify the disk that EFI volume lives on - you might have to trial and error it, but it SHOULD be disk 0)
select disk 0         (or whichever disk has your EFI partition)
list partition        (identify the partition the EFI volume lives on - this SHOULD correspond to the list volume results from before)
select partition 1    (usually the small ~100-500MB FAT32 System partition)

assign letter=Z       (mount the EFI volume to Z:)
exit                  (exit the DISKPART command line interface)
